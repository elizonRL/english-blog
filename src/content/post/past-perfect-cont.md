The Past Perfect Continuous, also known as the Past Perfect Progressive, is a verb tense used to show that an action was ongoing in the past up to a specific point in the past. It emphasizes the duration of an action before another action or time in the past.

## Structure

The structure of the Past Perfect Continuous is:

**Subject + had been + verb-ing**

* **Subject:** The person or thing performing the action.
* **had been:** The auxiliary verbs.
* **verb-ing:** The present participle of the main verb.

### Examples

* They had been waiting for hours when the train finally arrived.
* She had been working on the project all night, so she was exhausted.

### Interrogative Form

To form a question, invert the subject and "had":

**Had + subject + been + verb-ing?**

* Had you been waiting long when the bus arrived?
* Had she been working, when you called her?
